# My React knowledge

in this repo, i should find all the info needed for me to create a React app.

this app is a collection of:
- Express server, that serves static files, that's all what it does.
- a pre-script that generates ES5 compatible react code inside the public folder, by translating what's in the src folder, this is for generating multi-language versions.
